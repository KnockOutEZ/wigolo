wigolo runs on your machine as an MCP server and gives an AI coding agent one durable surface for everything web-related — **search, fetch, crawl, extract, cache, find-similar, research,** and autonomous gather loops. The core tools need no API keys, nothing it touches leaves `~/.wigolo/`, and there's no bill that grows with how much your agent thinks.

## Momentum

wigolo went public in early July 2026. It found its audience fast — **most of the stars below landed in a single 48-hour window.**

## Quickstart

Requires **Node ≥ 20** and ~1.5 GB of free disk. macOS, Linux, and Windows.

One command wires the local engine into your agent and sets up the MCP connection. It runs headlessly with no prompts — components (the browser engine and on-device models) download automatically on first use, so init itself is instant and downloads nothing:

```bash
npx wigolo init --non-interactive --agents=<your-agent>
```

- **`<your-agent>`** — one or more of `claude-code` · `cursor` · `codex` · `gemini-cli` · `vscode` · `windsurf` · `zed` · `antigravity` (comma-separated). wigolo writes the MCP config and instructions for you — nothing else to set up.
- **Any other MCP-capable agent?** Omit `--agents` — init still runs headlessly, and you point your agent at wigolo's MCP server (`npx wigolo mcp`) yourself.
- **Want the components ahead of time?** Add `--warmup` to pre-cache the browser engine and on-device models during init instead of on first use, or run `npx wigolo warmup --all` anytime. **Prefer a guided setup?** Add `--wizard` for the interactive terminal wizard.

That's the whole setup — **search, fetch, crawl, extract, cache, and find-similar work with no API key.** Check it's healthy:

```bash
npx wigolo doctor
```

Not for you? `npx wigolo config --uninstall --yes` removes everything, cleanly.

### Manual MCP setup (any other agent)

The `--agents` flag has a built-in installer for each agent listed above — but it can't cover every agent in the world. For **anything else — your own custom or in-house agent, or any MCP-capable client we don't wire automatically yet** — set wigolo up by hand: it's just another MCP server. Install the engine once, then register it:

```bash
npx wigolo init --non-interactive        # headless setup, no agent wiring (components download on first use)
```

Most clients use an `mcpServers` block in a JSON config file:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "wigolo": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "wigolo"]
    }
  }
}
```

`wigolo` with no subcommand starts the MCP stdio server (that is the default). If you installed it globally, use `"command": "wigolo", "args": []` instead.

**The file location — and the exact key — vary by client:**

| Agent | Config file | Servers key |
|-------|-------------|-------------|
| Cursor | `~/.cursor/mcp.json` | `mcpServers` |
| Windsurf | `~/.codeium/windsurf/mcp_config.json` | `mcpServers` |
| Gemini CLI | `~/.gemini/settings.json` | `mcpServers` |
| Antigravity | `~/.antigravity/mcp.json` | `mcpServers` |
| VS Code | user `mcp.json` (Command Palette → *MCP: Open User Configuration*) | `servers` |
| Zed | `~/.config/zed/settings.json` | `context_servers` |
| Claude Code | *(no file)* run `claude mcp add wigolo --scope user -- npx -y wigolo` (`--scope user` = global; drop it for project-only) | — |
| Codex | `~/.codex/config.toml` (TOML, not JSON) | `[mcp_servers.wigolo]` |
| Any other | wherever it registers MCP servers | its MCP-servers key |

Codex uses TOML instead of JSON:

```toml
[mcp_servers.wigolo]
command = "npx"
args = ["-y", "wigolo"]
```

To enable answer synthesis (below) for a hand-wired agent, add the provider and key to the server's `env`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "wigolo": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "wigolo"],
      "env": { "WIGOLO_LLM_PROVIDER": "gemini", "GEMINI_API_KEY": "<your-free-key>" }
    }
  }
}
```

### Let an AI set it up for you

Setup is simple enough to hand off to an AI. Ask your coding agent (Claude Code, Cursor, …) — or any chat assistant (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini) — to do it, and it can follow the steps above. Paste a prompt like:

> Set up the **wigolo** MCP server for my agent. wigolo is a local-first MCP server installed with `npx wigolo init --non-interactive` (engine only — no API keys). Then register it in my agent's MCP config as an `mcpServers` entry `{ "command": "npx", "args": ["-y", "wigolo"] }`. Note the per-client differences: **VS Code** uses the `servers` key with `"type": "stdio"`; **Zed** uses `context_servers`; **Codex** uses TOML `[mcp_servers.wigolo]`; **Claude Code** uses the CLI `claude mcp add wigolo --scope user -- npx -y wigolo`. My agent is **<name>** and its MCP config is at **<path, or "wherever it registers MCP servers">**.

That prompt is self-contained, so even an assistant with no web access can act on it. If the assistant *can* browse, point it at this README (the **Manual MCP setup** section above has every client's exact config path) or the project's machine-readable **`llms.txt`** — both carry the full procedure, including the optional LLM-synthesis `env` below.

### Optional — enable answer synthesis

`research`, `agent`, and `search format=answer` use an LLM to *write* the final answer. Turn them on by setting a **provider and its key** (in your shell, or in your agent's MCP `env` block). `WIGOLO_LLM_PROVIDER` names the LLM — set it alongside the key:

```bash
export WIGOLO_LLM_PROVIDER=gemini
export GEMINI_API_KEY=<your-key>      # free from https://aistudio.google.com/apikey — the free tier is plenty
```

Any provider works — use `anthropic` + `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `openai` + `OPENAI_API_KEY`, or `groq` + `GROQ_API_KEY`. To stay fully local and keyless, set `WIGOLO_LLM_PROVIDER=ollama` (or a local server URL) instead. Gemini is suggested because its free tier is more than enough for wigolo.

### Run with Docker

A prebuilt image runs the MCP server without installing Node yourself. The default command is the stdio MCP server. Two variants are published:

- **`latest`** (default) — a slim image. The OS libraries for the browser engine are baked in, but the browser engine binary and the on-device models download on first use into the data volume. Smallest download; ideal for long-lived MCP setups.
- **`latest-full`** — the browser engine binary is preinstalled at build time. Larger image; ideal for JS-render-heavy work or ephemeral `--rm` runs with no persistent volume.

The data volume is **mandatory** in every run line — it holds the local cache, the on-device models, the browser engine binary, and your encrypted keys, and persists them across runs. Without it, every run re-downloads those components:

```bash
docker run -i --rm -v wigolo-data:/data ghcr.io/knockoutez/wigolo
```

The `-i` flag keeps stdin open for the MCP protocol. On first use the slim image downloads the browser engine binary and the models into the volume (a one-time few-hundred-MB download); later runs reuse them. To skip the first-use browser-engine download, use the full variant:

```bash
docker run -i --rm -v wigolo-data:/data ghcr.io/knockoutez/wigolo:full
```

Wire either variant into Claude Code:

```bash
claude mcp add wigolo -- docker run -i --rm -v wigolo-data:/data ghcr.io/knockoutez/wigolo
```

Any MCP client works the same way: set `command` to `docker` and `args` to the run flags above. The image is also on Docker Hub as `towhid69420/wigolo`.

**HTTP serve mode.** For a remote or multi-client setup, run the HTTP daemon instead with the [`packaging/compose.serve.yml`](packaging/compose.serve.yml) snippet, which publishes port `3333` and adds a health check:

```bash
docker compose -f packaging/compose.serve.yml up
```

**Bind-mount caveat.** The container runs as an unprivileged user (uid/gid `1000`). A named volume (as above) just works. If you bind-mount a host directory instead (`-v "$PWD/wigolo-data:/data"`), that directory must be writable by uid `1000` or the container hits `EACCES` — either `chown 1000:1000` the host path first, or prefer the named volume.

## REST API & self-host

`wigolo serve` exposes a plain-JSON **REST API** alongside the MCP transport. Same process, same tools, two surfaces:

- **REST** at `POST /v1/{tool}` — curl-able, no MCP client needed. Request body is the tool's input; the response is the tool's output as plain JSON.
- **MCP** at `/mcp` (StreamableHTTP) and `/sse` — unchanged, for MCP clients.
- **OpenAPI 3.1** at `GET /openapi.json` — the machine-readable contract.
- **Discovery** at `GET /v1/tools` — `[{name, description, endpoint}]`.
- **Health** at `GET /health` — always open, no auth.

Start it on the default loopback address:

```bash
wigolo serve                       # 127.0.0.1:3333
```

### curl quickstart

All ten tools, against a local instance. Request bodies match each tool's input schema (the same schema MCP serves and OpenAPI publishes):

```bash
BASE=http://127.0.0.1:3333/v1

# search — multi-engine web search with ranked evidence
curl -sX POST $BASE/search   -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"query":"local-first software","max_results":5}'

# fetch — one URL to clean markdown + metadata
curl -sX POST $BASE/fetch    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"url":"https://example.com"}'

# crawl — multi-page crawl (bfs / dfs / sitemap / map)
curl -sX POST $BASE/crawl    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"url":"https://example.com","strategy":"map","max_pages":20}'

# cache — query everything already seen (or stats / clear)
curl -sX POST $BASE/cache    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"query":"local first"}'

# extract — structured data (tables, metadata, JSON-LD, schema, brand)
curl -sX POST $BASE/extract  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"url":"https://example.com","mode":"structured"}'

# find_similar — related pages by URL or concept
curl -sX POST $BASE/find_similar -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"concept":"local-first search engines","include_web":true}'

# research — multi-step research brief
curl -sX POST $BASE/research -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"question":"what is local-first software","depth":"quick"}'

# agent — autonomous data gathering
curl -sX POST $BASE/agent    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"prompt":"summarize this page","urls":["https://example.com"],"max_pages":1}'

# diff — compare two content snapshots
curl -sX POST $BASE/diff     -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"old":{"markdown":"a\nb"},"new":{"markdown":"a\nc"},"output":"summary"}'

# watch — register / list / check change-detection jobs
curl -sX POST $BASE/watch    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"action":"list"}'
```

The OpenAPI document lists every request field and the documented top-level response fields:

```bash
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:3333/openapi.json
```

### Authentication

Auth is **optional on loopback, fail-closed off it**:

- **Loopback bind, no token (default):** the API is open to local callers — a browser-`Origin` request is still refused, and only loopback `Host` headers are accepted.
- **Non-loopback bind:** the server **refuses to start** unless you set an API token or explicitly opt into open access. This is the guard that keeps a `--host 0.0.0.0` deployment from being wide open by accident.
- **Token set:** send `Authorization: Bearer <token>` on `/v1/*`, `/openapi.json`, the shim, and the MCP transport routes (`/mcp`, `/sse`). `/health` stays open.

Set the token by env var, or via a file (the standard Docker/systemd secret pattern — keeps it out of the process environment):

```bash
export WIGOLO_API_TOKEN="a-long-random-secret"
# or, file-based:
export WIGOLO_API_TOKEN_FILE=/run/secrets/wigolo_token

wigolo serve --host 0.0.0.0        # now requires the bearer token

curl -sX POST http://your-host:3333/v1/fetch \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $WIGOLO_API_TOKEN" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"url":"https://example.com"}'
```

To bind to a public interface **without** a token (e.g. behind your own auth proxy), opt in explicitly with `--allow-unauthenticated` (or `WIGOLO_SERVE_ALLOW_UNAUTHENTICATED=1`).

### Resource limits

Serve mode adds transport-level bounds on top of each tool's own defaults (MCP behaviour is unchanged). Override via env var:

| Env var | Default | What it bounds |
|---------|---------|----------------|
| `WIGOLO_SERVE_MAX_BODY_BYTES` | 1 MiB (5 MiB for `diff` / `extract`) | Request body size → `413` on overflow |
| `WIGOLO_SERVE_TIMEOUT_SCALE` | `1` | Multiplier on per-route deadlines (60s search/cache/diff/find_similar, 120s fetch/extract/watch, 300s crawl/research/agent) → `504` when exceeded |
| `WIGOLO_SERVE_MAX_CONCURRENCY` | `16` | In-flight `/v1` + shim requests → `429` when saturated |
| `WIGOLO_SERVE_REQUEST_TIMEOUT_MS` | `120000` | Whole-request slow-loris guard (Node `requestTimeout`). `0` disables |
| `WIGOLO_SERVE_HEADERS_TIMEOUT_MS` | `60000` | Header-receipt slow-loris guard (Node `headersTimeout`). `0` disables |
| `WIGOLO_SERVE_ALLOW_LOCAL_TARGETS` | unset | Set to `1` to allow loopback/localhost **target URLs** under a non-loopback bind (blocked by default so a remote caller can't probe the box's own services) |

Server-side parameter clamps (also published in OpenAPI so a generated SDK can't emit a rejected request): `crawl.max_pages` ≤ 200, `crawl.max_depth` ≤ 5, `agent.max_time_ms` ≤ 240000, `search` query array ≤ 10. An explicit over-cap value returns `400` with the cap in the hint.

### Self-host in one command

Docker (the API token makes a public bind safe; the volume persists cache, models, browser engine, and keys):

```bash
docker run -p 3333:3333 -v wigolo-data:/data \
  -e WIGOLO_API_TOKEN="a-long-random-secret" \
  ghcr.io/knockoutez/wigolo serve --host 0.0.0.0
```

Or use the [`packaging/compose.serve.yml`](packaging/compose.serve.yml) snippet (uncomment the token line before binding beyond loopback). Native:

```bash
WIGOLO_API_TOKEN="a-long-random-secret" wigolo serve --host 0.0.0.0
```

> **Token exposure note.** An env-var token is visible via `docker inspect` and `/proc/<pid>/environ` on the host. For hardened deployments use `WIGOLO_API_TOKEN_FILE` and mount the secret as a file (Docker/Kubernetes secrets, systemd `LoadCredential`) so it never enters the process environment.

### Firecrawl-compat shim (experimental)

An **experimental**, flag-gated shim mounts a lite subset of the Firecrawl v1 surface so a Firecrawl SDK can point its base URL at wigolo. Off by default; enable with `WIGOLO_FIRECRAWL_COMPAT=1`. It mounts at `/compat/firecrawl/v1` and covers **`scrape`, `search`, `map`, and `crawl`** only — batch, alternate formats (screenshot / changeTracking / rawHtml), the v2 surface, and webhooks are deliberately not implemented. Auth, limits, and target guarding apply identically to the shim.

```bash
WIGOLO_FIRECRAWL_COMPAT=1 wigolo serve
curl -sX POST http://127.0.0.1:3333/compat/firecrawl/v1/scrape \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"url":"https://example.com"}'
```

## Install channels

wigolo ships on five channels. **npm is the primary channel and works today** (`npx wigolo …` — the Quickstart above). The other four are packaging for release: their published artifacts (the `install.sh` URL, the Homebrew tap, and the container registries) go live **at first release** — see [`packaging/RELEASE-RUNBOOK.md`](packaging/RELEASE-RUNBOOK.md).

Pick the channel that matches how you run things, then wire the MCP command from the last column. **Wire wigolo with the absolute command shown — never rely on a `PATH` export.** MCP clients launch the server as a child process and do not read your shell profile, so a bare `wigolo` on `PATH` is invisible to them; use `npx`, or the channel's absolute binary path.

| Channel | Install | Upgrade | Uninstall | Recommended MCP command | Status |
|---------|---------|---------|-----------|-------------------------|--------|
| **npm** *(primary)* | `npm i -g wigolo` — or no install at all, just `npx wigolo` | `npm i -g wigolo@latest` (or nothing — `npx` always fetches latest) | `npx wigolo config --uninstall --yes` | `command: "npx"`, `args: ["-y", "wigolo"]` | **Verified** — macOS arm64; Windows covered by npm (CI matrix) |
| **curl \| sh** | `curl -fsSL https://wigolo.dev/install.sh \| sh` | re-run the same `curl … \| sh` (idempotent; reuses the bundled runtime) | `sh install.sh --uninstall` (keeps your cache/config) | `command: "$HOME/.wigolo/bin/wigolo"`, `args: []` | **Verified** — macOS arm64; URL live at first release |
| **Homebrew** | `brew install <org>/wigolo/wigolo` | `brew upgrade wigolo` | `brew uninstall wigolo` | `command: "$(brew --prefix)/bin/wigolo"`, `args: []` | **Verified** — macOS arm64; tap live at first release |
| **Docker** | `docker pull ghcr.io/knockoutez/wigolo` (see [Run with Docker](#run-with-docker)) | `docker pull ghcr.io/knockoutez/wigolo` (re-pull `latest`) | `docker rmi ghcr.io/knockoutez/wigolo` (+ `docker volume rm wigolo-data` to drop data) | `command: "docker"`, `args: ["run", "-i", "--rm", "-v", "wigolo-data:/data", "ghcr.io/knockoutez/wigolo"]` | **Verified** — linux-docker (arm64 native, amd64 emulated); registry live at first release |
| **Single-file binary** | download the release asset, `chmod +x wigolo` | download the new release asset (versionless `latest` URL) | `rm <path>/wigolo` (+ `rm -rf ~/.wigolo` to drop data) | `command: "/absolute/path/to/wigolo"`, `args: []` | macOS arm64 **verified**; linux-x64 / linux-arm64 / win-x64 **documented — unverified until CI**; **no Windows-native installer (documented gap — use npm on Windows)** |

**One channel at a time.** All channels share one data directory (`~/.wigolo` by default, `/data` in Docker). Running two different wigolo versions against the same data dir is undefined — pick one channel per machine and let it own the data dir.

**First-use downloads (every channel).** A fresh install is instant and downloads nothing. The embedding model and the browser engine binary download **on first use** into the data dir — a one-time few-hundred-MB download. To pre-cache them ahead of time, run `wigolo warmup --all` (or add `--warmup` to `init`).

### Channel caveats

- **curl \| sh and binary are headless-first.** They run every tool and the flag-driven `wigolo init`, but the **interactive setup wizard is not available** in the standalone binary — for a guided setup, use npm (`npx wigolo init --wizard`).
- **macOS binary signing.** Prebuilt macOS binaries are code-signed + notarized at release time and are safe to `curl`-download. If Gatekeeper still blocks a locally-copied binary (the quarantine attribute), clear it with `xattr -d com.apple.quarantine <binary>`. `curl` downloads set no quarantine attribute, so the curl channel is unaffected.
- **Versionless URLs.** The `install.sh` URL and the binary release-asset URLs are unversioned — they always resolve to the latest release. Upgrading is re-running the same command.
- **Docker data volume is mandatory.** The `-v wigolo-data:/data` mount holds the cache, models, browser engine binary, and encrypted keys. Without it, every run re-downloads them.

## SDKs (pre-release)

Thin, typed clients for the [REST API](#rest-api--self-host) live in this repo — **TypeScript** (`sdks/typescript/`: zero runtime dependencies, plain `fetch`, runs on Node ≥18 / Bun / Deno / edge runtimes) and **Python** (`sdks/python/`: standard library only, sync `Client` + `AsyncClient`, Python ≥3.10). One method per tool across all ten tools, env-driven configuration (`WIGOLO_BASE_URL`, `WIGOLO_API_TOKEN`), and an embedded local mode that finds or starts a local `wigolo serve` for you (`WIGOLO_LOCAL=1` in Python; `createLocalClient()` from the TypeScript local entry).

Published as `wigolo-sdk` on npm and `wigolo` on PyPI — each SDK's README (`sdks/typescript/README.md`, `sdks/python/README.md`) has the install line and a runnable quickstart. Both SDKs are contract-locked to the server's live `/openapi.json` by drift tests (`npm run test:sdk:ts`, `npm run test:sdk:py`).

## Framework integrations

Drop wigolo's tools into the agent framework you already use — opt-in wrappers live in [`packages/`](packages/), each thin over the MCP server or the SDKs, so the full ten-tool surface (including cache, find_similar, research, and agent — the four most frameworks' web tools don't have) comes along.

| Framework | Package | What you get |
|-----------|---------|--------------|
| **LangChain** | `packages/wigolo-langchain` | Each tool as a LangChain `BaseTool`, plus a `BaseRetriever` backed by search/find_similar for RAG chains. |
| **CrewAI** | `packages/wigolo-crewai` | wigolo tools as CrewAI `BaseTool`s via `wigolo_tools()`, ready to hand to any crew. |
| **LlamaIndex** | `packages/wigolo-llamaindex` | A `BaseReader` that loads fetched / crawled / searched pages as LlamaIndex documents. |
| **Vercel AI SDK** | `packages/wigolo-ai-sdk` | Tool factories for `generateText` / `streamText` `tools`, edge-friendly. |

Published as `wigolo-langchain`, `wigolo-crewai`, and `wigolo-llamaindex` on PyPI and `wigolo-ai-sdk` on npm; see each package's README for the import-and-call quickstart. They're opt-in extras — the core MCP server never depends on any framework.

## Tools

| Tool | What it does |
|------|--------------|
| 🔎 `search` | Multi-engine web search (18 direct adapters) with rank fusion, ML cross-encoder reranking, and an explainable per-result score. Pass a query **array** for parallel breadth. |
| 📄 `fetch` | Load one URL through a tiered router (HTTP → TLS-impersonation → headless browser) that auto-escalates on anti-bot challenges or SPA shells. Clean markdown + metadata + links. |
| 🕸️ `crawl` | Multi-page crawl — BFS, DFS, sitemap, or map-only. Per-domain rate limits, robots.txt respect, boilerplate dedup. |
| 🧩 `extract` | Structured data from a page: tables, metadata, JSON-LD, brand identity, named schemas (Article / Recipe / Product / …), or any custom JSON Schema. |
| 💾 `cache` | Query everything already seen — keyword (BM25) or hybrid (BM25 + on-device vectors). Plus stats, clear, and change detection. |
| 🧲 `find_similar` | Pages similar to a URL or a concept, via 3-way fusion of keyword + semantic + live web. |
| 🧠 `research` | Decompose a question → fan out sub-queries → fetch sources → synthesize a cited report (or a structured brief the host LLM writes from). |
| 🤖 `agent` | Autonomous gather loop: plan → search → fetch → extract → synthesize, with a step log, time budget, and optional output schema. |
| 🔁 `diff` + ⏱️ `watch` | See exactly what changed on a page since last visit; re-check on a schedule and deliver changes to a webhook. |

## Agent skills

wigolo ships an 11-pack skill catalog — one focused how-to per tool (search, fetch, crawl, extract, cache, find-similar, research, agent, diff, watch, plus an overview pack) — so your coding agent knows how to drive each tool well without you spelling it out. `wigolo init` installs them into every agent it wires up; you can also manage them directly:

```bash
wigolo skills add          # install into agents in the current project
wigolo skills add --global # install into your per-user agent config instead
wigolo skills list         # show what's installed and whether it's current
wigolo skills remove       # remove the packs wigolo installed
```

- **Project vs. global.** Default is the project you're in; `--global` targets your home-level agent config.
- **Idempotent.** Re-running `add` only rewrites what changed; already-current packs are left alone.
- **Receipts, not guesswork.** Every install is recorded, so `remove` (and `wigolo uninstall`) never removes files it can't verify it installed — hand-edited skills are detected and never clobbered.
- **Dry-run first.** Preview every create / update / skip before anything touches disk with `--dry-run`.

## Why it's different

wigolo isn't the free stand-in you settle for until the budget clears — it's built to hold the same line as the paid services in this lane, and it brings receipts. What actually separates it:

- **Built for agents, not humans.** One MCP call fans out many queries across many engines in parallel — something a serial host tool-loop can't replicate — with transparent per-result scoring and budget-aware output.
- **Honest output.** Stale cache, failed fetches, degraded backends, and truncation are surfaced in the result, never disguised as empty-but-successful data.
- **$0 per query, free to re-query.** Default search talks to public engines through direct adapters; the reranker and embeddings run on-device. Every response is cached, so asking again is instant and costs nothing.
- **Private by default.** Cache, embeddings, models, and config live under `~/.wigolo/`. Nothing reaches a third party unless you explicitly opt into an LLM for synthesis.

wigolo is a focused web layer for one agent on one machine — not a hosted SaaS, a vector database other apps query, or a browser-automation framework. Within that lane it goes toe-to-toe with the paid services on result quality — and the meter, the key, and the data-egress simply aren't there.

Here's what one real result looks like, dissected — including the failed engine and the weak result, because those are part of the answer too:

## Benchmark

> **All four tools converged on the same core answer — and only one of them handed back verbatim, byte-pinned evidence while doing it.**

One cold query, run live inside a single **Claude Fable 5** session and fanned out to four web tools on equal footing — built-in **WebSearch**, **wigolo**, **Tavily**, and **Exa** — then reported by the agent itself under one rule: judge on the evidence alone, no favoritism. The query: `when to choose logical vs streaming replication in Postgres`.

The headline is in the report itself: **all four tools converged on the same core answer.** Same top source as the paid tools, same conclusions — parity demonstrated, not asserted. On top of that, wigolo was the only tool of the four to return **verbatim quoted excerpts pinned to byte-offset source spans with citation IDs**, an **explainable per-result score decomposition** (cross-encoder, lexical, engine consensus), and **live per-engine telemetry** — and when two of its results were weak, **its own scorer flagged them as junk on-screen**. The cloud tools earn their line too: Exa rendered the official docs' comparison matrix in full. Both edges, stated straight, by the same model that drove all four tools.

One honest query, not a leaderboard — run your own and you'll see the same shape: the keyless local tool standing shoulder to shoulder with the paid services, handing your agent evidence the others don't, at $0 with nothing leaving your machine. Here's the full run:

### Same fight, different physics

The paid tools are genuinely good — that's what makes the parity interesting. The differences that remain aren't quality, they're physics:

| | wigolo | Firecrawl | Exa | Tavily |
|---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| Multi-engine web search | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Fetch & structured extraction | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Whole-site crawl & map | ✅ | ✅ | — | ✅ |
| Verbatim excerpts pinned to byte-offset source spans | ✅ | — | — | — |
| Explainable per-result score decomposition | ✅ | — | — | — |
| Persistent local memory — re-query instantly, offline | ✅ | — | — | — |
| Query data stays on your machine | ✅ | — | — | — |
| API key / account | none | required | required | required |
| Cost per query | $0 | metered | metered | metered |

That last row is the one that compounds — agents don't ask once, they ask in bursts:

## Architecture

A single Node process speaking MCP (JSON-RPC over stdio). Everything heavy is local and lazy-loaded, so a zero-key install pays nothing for the parts it isn't using.

- **Code beats model.** Deterministic work — canonicalization, rank fusion, dedup, schema matching, hashing — never touches an LLM. The model is reserved for judgment, opt-in, and capped per request. LLM-filled fields are checked against the source and nulled if absent, so hallucinations don't reach your output.
- **Routing on observable signals.** The fetch ladder escalates to a real browser on what it *sees* — SPA markers, challenge bodies, thin content — not domain guesses. It learns per-domain and unlearns when a site stops needing it.
- **Gets past most bot walls, keyless — and says so when it can't.** The ladder runs UA rotation on a bare `403`, TLS-fingerprint impersonation, a hardened headless browser, and it waits out interstitial challenges to capture the clearance cookie and reuse it per-domain. That clears the common JS-challenge sites with no keys and no third party. The honest ceiling: managed-challenge networks with IP reputation scoring (think the strictest job-board and review sites) still won't hand a datacenter or fresh residential IP a clearance — for those you opt into a proxy, a challenge-solver sidecar, or a hosted reader (all off by default). When a page stays blocked, wigolo returns a labeled `blocked_by_challenge` failure — never a challenge shell dressed up as content.
- **Transparent, honest results.** Every result carries a score breakdown and a query-understanding block; degraded state is always surfaced, never hidden. wigolo self-tunes which fetch tier to try first per domain; `wigolo tune list` shows what it learned and `wigolo tune reset` clears it.

## Configuration

A clean install works out of the box. A few settings meaningfully raise output quality — set them as environment variables or in your agent's MCP `env` block.

```bash
# 1. Synthesis — the biggest lever. research / agent / search-answer need an LLM
#    to write the final text. Set the provider AND its key (a key alone is ignored).
export WIGOLO_LLM_PROVIDER=gemini                   # names the LLM; free tier is plenty (or anthropic/openai/groq)
export GEMINI_API_KEY=<your-key>                    # that provider's key (ANTHROPIC_API_KEY / OPENAI_API_KEY / …)
#   ...or fully local & keyless:  export WIGOLO_LLM_PROVIDER=ollama   (or a local http URL)

# 2. Wider retrieval funnel
export WIGOLO_SEARCH=hybrid                         # core engines + aggregator fallback
export WIGOLO_GITHUB_TOKEN=...                      # GitHub code search 10 → 30 req/min + org-private

# 3. Land more fetches, stay warm
export WIGOLO_TLS_TIER=auto                         # per-domain TLS-impersonation past Cloudflare/DataDome
export WIGOLO_EAGER_WARMUP=1                        # pay the ~1s model load up front, not on first search
```

For repeated interactive use, run `wigolo serve` so the browser pool, embeddings, and reranker stay resident across calls. To stay 100% on-device, a local LLM endpoint + `WIGOLO_TLS_TIER=auto` is the honest minimal set.

**Per-call habits that pay off:** query **arrays** (`["a","b","c"]`) for parallel breadth · `search_depth: "deep"` for queries that matter · `include_domains` as a hard filter for docs lookups.

<summary><b>CLI commands</b></summary>

| Command | What it does |
|---------|--------------|
| `wigolo` / `wigolo mcp` | Start the MCP stdio server (the default command). |
| `wigolo <tool> <args>` | Run any tool once, headlessly — `search`, `fetch`, `crawl`, `extract`, `cache`, `find-similar`, `research`, `agent`, `diff`, `watch`. Add `--json` for machine-readable output (results on stdout, logs on stderr, exit code 0/1); `--help` on each tool lists its flags. Example: `wigolo search "rust async runtimes" --limit 5 --json`. |
| `wigolo init` | Set up wigolo headlessly: wire into detected agents, persist settings (components download on first use). `--non-interactive --agents=<csv> --provider=<name> --search=<backend>` for CI; `--warmup` to pre-cache components; `--wizard` for the interactive TUI; `--json` for a machine-readable summary. |
| `wigolo setup mcp` | Re-write just the MCP server entries, without the full wizard (`--json`). |
| `wigolo doctor` | Cold-start health check — no network fetches. `--fix` auto-repairs known failures (re-download missing models, install the browser engine, clear stale sidecar state, reset engine breakers — including on a running daemon); `--json` for a machine-readable report. |
| `wigolo verify` | End-to-end smoke test (fetch, crawl, extract, search, rerank, embed) (`--json`). |
| `wigolo serve` | HTTP daemon — keeps subsystems warm across multiple clients. A taken port fails with an actionable message naming `--port`. |
| `wigolo shell` | Interactive REPL with tab completion for every command and flag. Pipe a command script to `wigolo shell --json` and each command returns one line of JSON (NDJSON); a non-zero exit means at least one command failed — fully scriptable. |
| `wigolo tune` | Inspect and reset what wigolo learned per domain — which fetch tier it prefers, challenge-clearance state, and backoff windows. `tune list` / `tune show <domain>` / `tune reset <domain>` / `tune reset --all`, all with `--json`. |
| `wigolo config` | Settings TUI; or headless `--set K=V`, `--export`, `--import`, `--cleanup`, `--uninstall --yes` (`--json` with `--plain`). |
| `wigolo status` | Plain-text status summary (`--json`). |
| `wigolo health` | Ping a running daemon's `/health` (`--json`; exit code = status). |
| `wigolo warmup` | Optional pre-cache of components for CI/offline: `--all` (browser + models), `--browser`, `--embeddings`, `--reranker`, `--searxng` (opt-in search sidecar). Nothing requires warmup — everything downloads on first use. `--json` for a machine-readable result. |
| `wigolo backfill` | Embed cached pages that have no vector yet (`--batch-size`, `--dry-run`, `--json`). |
| `wigolo plugin add\|list\|remove` | Manage custom extractor / search-engine plugins (`--json`). |
| `wigolo auth` | Show configured browser-auth sources — CDP endpoint, Chrome profile, storage state (`--json`; never prints secret values). |
| `wigolo uninstall` | Remove wigolo from agent configs (keeps your cache). `--yes` to skip confirmation, `--json` for a machine-readable plan+result. |

Every command speaks `--json` for scripting and AI drivers (the exceptions are the `serve` daemon and the `mcp` protocol stream). Output on stdout is always a single machine-readable document; logs go to stderr; the exit code reflects success.

## Beta & feedback

wigolo is in **public beta**. Everything documented here works and is held to a 7,600-test suite — beta is about the polish bar, not stability. It stays beta until enough people have used it, kicked it, and starred it that calling it v1 means something.

That makes your feedback the whole game right now. Every report is read, usually the same day:

- 🐛 **[Report a bug](https://github.com/KnockOutEZ/wigolo/issues/new?template=bug_report.yml)** — broke, misbehaved, surprised you
- 💡 **[Request a feature](https://github.com/KnockOutEZ/wigolo/issues/new?template=feature_request.yml)** — something it should do
- 💬 **[Ask anything](https://github.com/KnockOutEZ/wigolo/discussions)** — questions, setups, show & tell

And if wigolo earns a place in your setup, the ways to keep it alive: a ⭐ **star** (it's how open source gets found), a **[☕ coffee](https://buymeacoffee.com/knockoutez)** (there's no paid tier and never will be), or just **[an email](mailto:ktowhid20@gmail.com)** — it goes straight to the one developer who wrote the code.

## FAQ

<details>
<summary><b>Free? What's the catch?</b></summary>

No catch by design. The expensive parts — ranking, embeddings, the browser engine — run on *your* hardware, so there's no per-query cost to recover and no reason for a meter. Sustained by donations; the AGPL license legally prevents a bait-and-switch into a closed hosted product.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Is the quality really on par with the paid services?</b></summary>

Run one query and judge — the benchmark section above is a live 4-way run, not a chart. Everyday agent queries land at parity; the paid tools still win some deep-extraction edge cases, and crawling is where wigolo is strongest. Every result shows its scoring, so you don't have to take anyone's word for it.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Won't public search engines block or rot?</b></summary>

It's engineered for exactly that: 18 engines fused with rank fusion (any one failing barely moves results), a tiered fetch ladder with per-domain learning, and an optional aggregator fallback. Degraded backends are *reported in the output*, never hidden — and the local cache means everything already seen keeps working regardless.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Is this kind of scraping OK?</b></summary>

wigolo reads the public web the way a browser does — robots.txt respected by default, per-domain rate limits, research-grade volumes for one agent on one machine. It's deliberately the polite end of the spectrum, not a harvesting platform.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>AGPL — can I use this at work?</b></summary>

Yes, freely, company-wide. The license only bites if you *modify wigolo and run it as a network service* — then you must publish those modifications. Using it as a local dev tool carries zero obligation. Commercial-licensing questions: reach out.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Why 1.5 GB of disk?</b></summary>

That's the on-device brain: a full browser engine plus the ranking and embedding models the cloud services run on their side and bill you for. Disk is cheap; meters aren't.

Bug reports, feature requests, and PRs are all welcome — see **[CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md)**. Keep tool handlers thin (business logic lives in the domain modules), add tests, and run the suite before opening a PR. wigolo also has a plugin system for custom extractors and search engines: `wigolo plugin add <git-url>`.

The single-file binary channel (`npm run build:binary`) uses two build-only devDependencies — `@yao-pkg/pkg` (packages the CJS bundle into a standalone executable) and `esbuild` (bundles the dist to CommonJS). They are needed only for that build; the npm package and all runtime tools do not depend on them.

The REST API validates request bodies against the tool schemas with `ajv` (a runtime dependency, dynamically imported only when the REST surface is first hit — it never loads in stdio MCP mode). The OpenAPI document is checked against the 3.1 meta-schema in tests via the `@seriousme/openapi-schema-validator` devDependency (dev-only).

The one obligation: if you run a **modified** version as a network service, you must publish your modified source under the same license. That keeps wigolo open while preventing a closed, hosted fork. See **[SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md)** to report a vulnerability and **[TRADEMARK.md](TRADEMARK.md)** for use of the name.
